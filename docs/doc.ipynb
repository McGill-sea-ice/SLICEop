    "to perform a multiple linear regression that predicts the date on which the water temperature near Montreal drops to the freezing point and ice formation begins. \n",

    "The water temperature and actual date of freeze-up are observed at the [Longueuil water treatment plant](https://www.longueuil.quebec/fr/eau-potable) near Montreal.\n",

    "The three predictor variables have been found to best predict the freeze-up date based on [extensive testing by Amélie Bouchat](https://github.com/McGill-sea-ice/SLICE).\n",
    "They also tested the use of machine learning for the forecast, which was found to perform worse on medium to seasonal time scales. "
