    "We use time series of September total cloud cover, November snowfall and December 2 m – air temperature from the [ECMWF's seasonal forecast system](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/documentation-and-support/long-range)\n",

    "$\\text{FUD}(y) = a_{0} + a_{1}x_{1}(y) + a_{2}x_{2}(y) + a_{3}x_{3}(y)$,  \n",
    "where $x_{1}$ is the September cloud cover, $x_{2}$ the November snowfall, $x_{3}$ the December 2m-air temperature and we try to find the coefficients $a_{0}$, $a_{1}$, $a_{2}$, $a_{3}$ that best predict $\\text{FUD}$. Once the coefficients are found based on previous years we can forecast the $\\text{FUD}$ of the current season by putting in some predictor variables $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, $x_{3}$ for the current season.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictor variables are extracted from the [SEAS5.1 seasonal forecast](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/elibrary/80921-seas5-and-future-evolution-long-range-forecast-system) starting in July of each year. Once data for a given predictor variables becomes available from ERA5, the SEAS5.1 forecast data is replaced by the equivalent [ERA5 reanalysis](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5) data: *e.g.* in mid October, the total cloud cover for September is available from ERA5 and is used to do the forecast instead of the forecasted total cloud cover.  \n",
    "The water temperature and actual date of freeze-up are observed at the [Longueuil water treatment plant](https://www.longueuil.quebec/fr/eau-potable) near Montreal. The river is assumed to start freezing up when the water temperature at the water treatment plant falls below 0.75$^{\\circ}$C, which has been shown to correlate best with observed freeze-up dates from other sources like the [St-Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation (SLSMC)](https://greatlakes-seaway.com/en/) or ice charts based on reconnaissance flights by the [Canadian Coast Guard](https://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/index-eng.html). \n",
    "The three predictor variables have been found to best predict the freeze-up date based on [extensive testing by Amélie Bouchat](https://github.com/McGill-sea-ice/SLICE).\n",
    "They also tested the use of machine learning for the forecast, which was found to perform worse on medium to seasonal time scales.\n",

    "1. [**`daily_Twater.py`**](https://github.com/McGill-sea-ice/SLICEop/blob/main/SLICEop/downloads/daily_Twater.py) Water temperature is tranferred from the water treatment plant daily with a temporal resolution of one minute. The daily average is computed and added to the time series (`Twater_Longueuil_updated.nc`) after a basic quality control to remove outliers that are either warmer than 30$^{\\circ}$C or exhibit a spike in temperature (defined as a temperature change of more than 1$^{\\circ}$C per hour). \n",

[**`monthly_SEAS51_ERA5.py`**](https://github.com/McGill-sea-ice/SLICEop/blob/main/SLICEop/downloads/monthly_SEAS51_ERA5.py) The ECMWF's SEAS5.1 seasonal forecast is run every 1st of the month and the data made available on the 5th. Starting in July, we try to download the desired variables on the 7th (to allow for a small buffer of 2 days in case of delays). Once past the month of a specific variable (September for total cloud cover etc.), we download the ECMWF's ERA5 reanalysis data instead to benefit from the actual observations incorporated into ERA5.\n",
    "2. [**`monthly_preprocess.py`**](https://github.com/McGill-sea-ice/SLICEop/blob/main/SLICEop/prepro/monthly_preprocess.py) The preprocessing consists mainly of the computation of monthly averages (September total cloud cover, December 2 m – air temperature) and sums (November snowfall). For SEAS5.1 the preprocessing is done for each ensemble member and the ensemble mean.\n",
    "3. [**`monthly_forecast.py`**](https://github.com/McGill-sea-ice/SLICEop/blob/main/SLICEop/auto/monthly_forecast.py) The regression model built from the yearly time series of the predictor variables is used with the monthly averages/sums from SEAS5.1 and/or ERA5 in order to predict the freeze-up date.

    "2. [**`weekly_preprocess.py`**](https://github.com/McGill-sea-ice/SLICEop/blob/main/SLICEop/prepro/weekly_preprocess.py) If ERA5 data was downloaded in the step before, here we compute a monthly average or sum based on the combination of ERA5 and SEAS5.1 data. The preprocessing is performed for each ensemble member and the ensemble mean of SEAS5.1. If applicable, the SEAS5.1 data in each of the ensemble members is replaced by the same ERA5 data. \n",
    "3. [**`weekly_forecast.py`**](https://github.com/McGill-sea-ice/SLICEop/blob/main/SLICEop/auto/weekly_forecast.py) The forecast is performed exactly the same way as before for the monthly forecast.\n",
